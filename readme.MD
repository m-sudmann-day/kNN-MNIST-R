# k-Nearest Neighbors in R

R scripts are provided for k-Nearest Neighbor predictions.

kNN.R contains a general prediction function kNN() optimized for performance.

kNN_genData.R applies the above function to a training set containing waveform data.

kNN_MINST.R peforms predictions of handwritten digits with approximately 94% accuracy.
